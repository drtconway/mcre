# MCRE - an editor for recipies in the modernist cuisine style

## What is Modernist Cuisine?

The Modernist Cuisine is a cooking and food preparation style
inspired by the idea that many traditional cooking techniques and
recipes have arisen because they achieve a particular objective
which we can characterize in scientific terms. If we can understand
that objective, and how traditional cooking techniques achieve that
objective, the idea goes, then we can use new techniques based on
modern science and technology to achieve that objective in new and
interesting ways.

A key example is that perfectly cooked meat has delicious browning
on the outside, which arises partly from caramelization of constituent
compounds in the meat whe subjected to high temperature, along with
Maillard reactions - chemical reactions between the sugars and amino
acids in the meat, again at high temperature. At the same time,
perfectly cooked meat should be nice and moist, not hard and dried
out. A key factor for controlling this is the maximum temperature
that has been reached in the interior of the piece of meat.  As the
meat heats up, proteins in the muscle fibers begin to denature
causing the meat to compact, squeezing out moisture. The myosin
proteins begin to give up around 50ºC, and the actin proteins around
66ºC-73ºC. Thus, for many cuts of meat, keeping the internal
temperature below 66ºC is important to avoid it becoming unpleasantly
hard and dry. This of course is antagonistic to the goal of achieving
good browning on the outside, which requires much higher temperatures.
With traditional cooking, we usually achieve this by frying the
meat in a hot pan, turning frequently, so that as the outside browns,
the interior gradually heats up to the right temperature. It requires
a lot of experience to achieve good results consistently, since it
is easy to misjudge and over-cook or under-cook the middle of the
meat. So, the modernist approach is to use a *sous vide* (French
for *under vacuum*): the meat is vacuum sealed in plastic, then put
in a temperature controlled water bath, set to the target temperature
for the interior of the meat (e.g. 56ºC-58ºC for medium rare eye
fillet beef), and the cooking takes place over an hour or two (the
exact time is not important - which makes it very adaptable), and
then the meat is taken out, patted dry, and then the outside is
browned quickly by the application of high heat. That could be
searing in a very hot pan for a few seconds on either side; searing
with a blow-torch; or even deep frying. Thus the interior is cooked
to a perfect degree, and we get the level of browning we want. Even
better, since the cooking time in the sous vide is flexible, you
can put the meat in with time to spare, and then only a minute or
so is needed at serving time. As an added bonus, depending on the
temperature, the sous vide process can act as very effective
pasteurization, so if you don't open the plastic pouch, the meat
can sit in the fridge for a week or two, ready to reheat.

## What is the deal with Modernist Cuisine recipes?

The traditional arrangement of recipes is to have a list of
ingredients followed by a list of instructions. Some recipes
segregate the ingredient list when the dish has multiple
components, though, confusingly this is not always the case.
Modernist recipes are layed out more in the style of a laboratory
protocol, where each step of the recipe has the key information
for that step layed out together. This is perhaps less convenient
for compiling your shopping list, but it makes it very clear what
is required for each step of the recipe. This is particularly
useful when more than one step uses the same ingredient, or when
precise temperatures or times are required.
